# SCP DETECTIVES

---

### *Introduction*

Welcome to the SCP Detective Game, an interactive web application where you'll embark on a journey through an alternate universe known as the SCP universe. As a detective, you'll uncover the secrets of the universe through the use of an unusual application/OS, which grants you access to a vast and intricate video game world filled with objects, creatures, and characters.

Throughout the game, you'll have the opportunity to explore, interact, and modify your inventory using a variety of skills, including exploration, hacking, communication, and item usage. As you progress, you'll learn new abilities and hone your existing skills to become a better detective. You'll encounter puzzles and challenges that require you to use your skills and inventory to solve, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement.

But that's not all! In addition to the main game, you can team up with other detectives to explore the SCP universe together, adding a social aspect to the game. You can also interact with non-player characters who have their own stories, motivations, and personalities, allowing you to influence their story outcomes. The SCP universe has a rich and detailed backstory, filled with interesting stories, characters, and lore, adding depth and meaning to your exploration and discovery.

But the fun doesn't end there! The game will support modding, allowing you to create and share your own modifications to the game, including custom levels, items, creatures, and more. And the game will also be available on mobile devices, so you can take your detective adventures with you on the go.

So, what are you waiting for? Join us on this exciting journey through the SCP universe, where hidden secrets are waiting to be uncovered by the most diligent detectives. Start playing today and let your imagination run wild!
